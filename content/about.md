I'm an IT professional with a passion for secure systems architecture. I have professional experience in Splunk and Linux systems administration, and a personal interest in cryptography. I may post articles or projects to this site based on my interests at the time. 

I'm also an amateur photographer. I've recently been focusing on motorsports photography, and am also interested in wildlife and astrophotography. You can find some of my work [here](/photography).

I'm passionate about countering light pollution and work on this locally with [DarkSky Maryland](https://darkskymd.org/). Please reach out if you're interested in learning more or getting involved! 

I was formerly a PhD student in Mathematics, with a focus in algebraic number theory. An archive of some of my academic papers can be found [here](/papers).
